	*	These two variables are a bit odd. Basically I have added these to help replicate
	*	the way that most user interface systems work. When a button press occurs, if no
	*	other button is held down then the co-ordinates of where that click occured are stored.
	*	If other buttons are pressed when another button is pressed it will not update these
	*	values.
	*
	*	This allows us to "Set the Focus" to a specific portion of the screen. For example,
	*	in maya, clicking the Alt+LMB in a view allows you to move the mouse about and alter
	*	just that view. Essentually that viewport takes control of the mouse, therefore it is
	*	useful to know where the first click occured....

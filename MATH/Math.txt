Solving for Theta1

We don't need to solve for Theta1 since it will always be 90 deg


Solving for Theta2

If we are incrementing the x component, Theta2 will not change since we should only have to move
the prismatic joint inn the direction of the change. i.e. x +1, translate prismatic right

If we are incrementing the y component, the prismatic joint will have to move as well as the last joint. 
If the last joint moves up, the prismatic joint will need to move towards joint 3's (x,y)
the number of units y changed
If the last joint moves down, the prismatic joint should move away from joint 3's (x,y)
the number of units y changed

Given the X and Y of the last link (easily observable)
Using Law of Cosines:

X^2 + Y^2 = L1^2 + L2^2 - (L1)(L2)(cos(180 + Theta2))

reduced to:

cos(Theta2) = (X^2 + Y^2 - (L1^2 + L2^2)) / (2(L1)(L2))

Theta2 = cos^-1((X^2 + Y^2 - (L1^2 + L2^2)) / (2(L1)(L2)))

Solving for Theta3

/*Since Theta1 + Theta2 + Theta3 = SUM
And we should know the SUM

Theta3 = SUM - (Theta1 + Theta2)*/

I believe Theta3 should also remain unchanged
Paul if you could take a look at this part
